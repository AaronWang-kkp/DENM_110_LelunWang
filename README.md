It's my DENM-110 robotics coursework.
The coursework was written by Matlab2021b and the Simulink module need to open and implement at the right Matlab version.
So, I saved a 2016b version, which is can be open by the version over the Matlab2016b.
If you can run the version on Matlab2021b, you can download the module from v2021 folder.
# How to run?
you should run the Robotrun.m.
so easy~
